I am also getting a certificate in Digital Studies. I grew up in Short Hills, New Jersey and went to Millburn High School. At UW-Madison I am involved in many clubs such as The FIT Magazine, The Womens Network, and Madison Marketing. I am also a member of Alpha Epsilon Phi. One of my favorite activities is watching movies. I have seen so many. Here are a few of my top movies three different genres. Enjoy! </p>
